# Behavioral Logic Heterograph Learning Enhanced with Expert Experience to Identify Operational Risks
## Abstract
Operational risks are a prevalent issue across various industries, potentially causing substantial losses each year. The identification and prevention of operational risks have been drawing significant attention. 
However, operational risks have three characteristics that make identification challenging: (a) involvement of multiple interrelated heterogeneous entities, (b) insufficient risk labels due to their low frequency, and (c) dynamically changing risk patterns.
For addressing such three issues, we here propose a novel risk identification framework combining graph pretraining with fine-tuning. 
In the graph pretraining stage, behavioral logic is depicted by heterographs, which are then mapped into low-dimensional vectors by a heterograph learning algorithm enhanced with expert experience.
By injecting expert experience, subtle changes in operational risk features can be captured.
During the fine-tuning phase, we devise a risk identification model built upon psychological behavioral analysis. This model exhibits superior generalization performance, particularly in scenarios with limited risk labels and shifting risk patterns.
Experiments conducted on a series of operational risk datasets have demonstrated that our framework exhibits outstanding performance.
